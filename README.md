# Unicrypto : An Open Source CryptoCurrency Exchange
Unicrypto is an open source cryptocurrency exchange that supports multiple fiat currencies.
At this point, the exchange only supports one cryptocurrency at a time. I plan to adapt the project to a multiple-crypto-currency
environment soon.
Unicrypto is configured to use Bitcore as the default banking services provider.
